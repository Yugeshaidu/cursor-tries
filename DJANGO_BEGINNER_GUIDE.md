# Django Simple Framework - Beginner's Guide 🚀

## What is Django? (Explain Like I'm 5)

Think of Django like a **magic toolbox** for building websites! 🧰

Just like how LEGO blocks help you build amazing structures, Django gives you pre-built "blocks" (called components) to build websites quickly and easily.

## 📁 Project Structure Explained

### Root Directory Files

```
workspace/
├── manage.py                     # 🎮 The "remote control" for your Django project
├── requirements.txt              # 📋 Shopping list of Python packages needed
├── logs/                        # 📝 Where error messages and activity logs are stored
├── django_env/                  # 🏠 Virtual environment (isolated Python space)
├── simple_django_framework/     # ⚙️ Main project settings folder
└── main_app/                    # 🏗️ Your main application folder
```

### What Each File Does

#### `manage.py` 🎮
- **What it is**: The "magic wand" that lets you control your Django project

- **What they do**: Help your website talk to web servers
- **Think of them like**: Translators that help your website speak "internet language"

### Main App Folder: `main_app/` 🏗️

This is where you build the actual features of your website:

#### `models.py` 🗄️
- **What it is**: The blueprint for your database
- **What it does**: Defines what kind of information you want to store (users, posts, etc.)

- **Think of it like**: A business card that introduces your app to Django

#### `tests.py` 🧪
- **What it is**: A quality checker for your code
- **What it does**: Automatically tests if your code works correctly
- **Think of it like**: A spell-checker for code - finds mistakes automatically

#### `migrations/` folder 📦
- **What it is**: A history book of changes to your database
- **What it does**: Keeps track of how your database structure changes over time
